* I will provide a **reel script** (the narration I’ll speak while sharing the screen).
* You need to generate an **`index.html` file** inside a folder, based on the given topic.
* In the **`index.html`**, we will use:

  * **Tailwind CSS** for styling
  * **GSAP** for animations
  * **Chart.js** for charts
  * **ReactBits code snippets** where applicable
* The page should feel like a **modern presentation (PPT style)**, with multiple sections.
* Theme: **Dark mode with a clean, professional look.**
* Each section should:

  * Represent roughly **5 seconds** of the script (one section per \~5s narration).
  * Be visually engaging, with smooth GSAP animations.
  * Include **charts** wherever relevant, styled nicely with Chart.js.
* Overall requirements:

  * Sections must be **well-structured and modern looking**.
  * UX should be **smooth, professional, and easy to follow**.
  * Tailwind should be used consistently for all styling.
